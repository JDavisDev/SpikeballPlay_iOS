/* DIFFICULTY NOTES
 
 Could go with a rating system. each player starts at 500. Get a bump if you win, drop if you lose
 Then, as matches are predicted, results are weighed against expectations.
 Win * Expected Win == less points up
 Win * Expected Loss == more points up
 
 Loss * Expected Win == more points down
 Loss * Expected Loss == less points down
 
 Could Iterate through each player's opponents. Assign a point value to each game.
